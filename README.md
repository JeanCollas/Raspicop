# Raspicop
Implementation of a C++ Raspberry quadricopter

It is 'another' Picopter project, which still needs a lot of work to compete some other more advanced projects.
This project has been mainly done for fun, and started from scratch for educational purposes (Github, Raspberry, C++, sensors, ...).
It is composed of several modules, and is not finished yet, the application framework is done but the pilot is missing :)

I have started this repository to share my -very high- number of issues faced while implementing, hope this will help some people. It aims at being improved.

More to come!

\o/ My first Github repository filled!

# History
I started this project by buying a Raspberry Pi 2, some sensors, ESC and motors. 
More details to come...

# What this code does

For the moment it is limited to the MPU control, some console interaction over SSH, some display console and 3D via GTK over SSH, that will be extended to radio-communication.
The control of ESCs will be implemented using the Servoblaster library of richardghirst.

# Howto

    make
    sudo ./Raspicop 2> errorOutput

# Hardware

## Yet handled

    Raspberry Pi 2
    Wifi dongle
    MPU-6050 (Accelerometer, Gyroscope)
    
## To come

    ESCs (half way)
    HC-SR04 (Distance sensor), half way
    GY-264 HMC5883L (Compass)
    RFM12B (radio transmitters)
    or HC-12 SI4463 (wireless serial port)
    3G USB key (if ok with power consumption)
    HC-SR501 (Infrared sensor)
    Camera + Infrared camera
    Battery checker
    
    Some Arduino delegation is useful
    
    
# Software
    Raspbian Jessie
    bcm2835 library
    gtkmm
    
## To come
    a way to work I2C in user land (currently sudo)
